This repository holds software to be used for nested sampling on an arbitrary data set.

The routine can be run as on the SDE framework by using the files in the SDE_example directory with the SDE_skel.m routine.

To run the nested sampling routine on a custom data set, a new skeleton file like SDE_skel.m must be constructed specifying at the functions described in the comments in ns_processdataset.m
